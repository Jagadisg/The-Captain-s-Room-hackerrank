# Mr. Anant Asankhya is the manager at the INFINITE hotel. The hotel has an infinite amount of rooms.

# One fine day, a finite number of tourists come to stay at the hotel.
# The tourists consist of:
# → A Captain.
# → An unknown group of families consisting of N members per group where K ≠ 1.

# The Captain was given a separate room, and the rest were given one room per group.

# Mr. Anant has an unordered list of randomly arranged room entries. The list consists of the room numbers for all of the tourists. The room numbers will appear k times per group except for the Captain's room.

# Mr. Anant needs you to help him find the Captain's room number.
# The total number of tourists or the total number of groups of families is not known to you.
# You only know the value of k and the room number list.
